## Epitech Project (1st year)

Student project.
Made in less than one week. Collisions are badly designed (tryed a way to implement them that was just the wrong way to do it, the joys of experiencing new things...).

[You can read this PDF file if you want to understand properly which specifications I had to implement.](./runner.pdf)

I just hope that your gf/bf will cheat you too.
